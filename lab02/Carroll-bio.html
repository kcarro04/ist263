<h1>Kelly Carroll's Biography</h1>
<h2>Personal Info</h2>
<p>    My name is Kelly Carroll and I am a <strong>sophomore Advertising student</strong> at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, with a minor in Information Management and Technology. My combination of study allows me to access my creativity in today’s technology-driven world. While I have a comprehensive interest in all aspects of Advertising, my major’s emphasis is Digital Project Management, which highlights my digital strategy, management, and strong writing and verbal communication skills.</p> 

<p>I am interested in pursuing a career in the media and/or entertainment industry. On campus, I have been involved with various clubs and organizations including Orange Seeds, the first year professional development and leadership program, TNH, the student-run advertising agency where I work as a creative team member, Club Lacrosse, Newhouse Peer Advisory program, and my social sorority Phi Sigma Sigma. Outside of my campus involvement, I enjoy spending time in nature and exploring new places with friends, doing arts and crafts projects, and planning hypothetical trips.</p>

<p>Traveling is one of my major passions, and growing up I always loved to plan trips that my family would never end up going on. One of my favorite memories is when my best friend, Bronwyn, and I planned the summer of our dreams during our junior year of high school. We orchestrated a detailed plan and itinerary spanning four week in four different European countries where we would stay with distant relatives. After a sincere presentation to my parents and a couple months of proving I was mature enough to travel alone with just my best friend across the world, my parents said yes. So, we went on this month-long trip to Ireland, England, France, and Italy the summer prior to the pandemic, had the best summer ever, and I came back with the most special memories. SInce then, my passion and excitement about traveling has only increased. </p>
