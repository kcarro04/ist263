    <div> <p class="aboutme"> The summer going into my senior year of highschool my best friend, Bronwyn, and I planned the summer of our dreams in Europe. We never thought that we would actually go, but to our surprise our parents agreed to our plan. We went to 4 different countries: Ireland, England, Italy, and France. First stop was Ireland. We visited Dublin, Galways, and Roscommon which is a rural area where my grandma grew up. Second stop was England and we stayed in Whitney with Bronwynâ€™s grandparents. Then we went to Paris for a couple days. And lastly, we went to Italy to a small coastal town called Nervi in Geneva. Each place was so special and unique and it was the best summer of my life!
